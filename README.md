# Technical Assessment: Multi-Tenant Project & Task Management Platform

## Candidate name: Akeza Aimee Princesse

## Senior Software Engineer Assessment

**Timebox:** 3-4 days\
**Submission:** GitHub repository\
**Primary Goal:** Evaluate senior-level engineering ability across
architecture, security, backend design, database engineering,
reliability, testing, DevOps, and technical judgment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Assessment Overview

Build a **production-oriented, Dockerized, secure multi-tenant Project &
Task Management Platform**.

This assessment intentionally goes beyond basic CRUD. We are evaluating
how you design and implement a system that could realistically be
operated in production.

The solution should demonstrate:

-   Strong software architecture
-   Secure authentication and authorization
-   Strict multi-tenant data isolation
-   PostgreSQL database design
-   Redis usage and cache invalidation
-   Concurrency handling
-   Reliable background processing
-   API design
-   Automated testing
-   Docker and deployment practices
-   Observability and operational readiness
-   Backup and recovery thinking
-   Clear technical documentation
-   Good engineering judgment when using AI-assisted development

> **Important:** You do not need to implement every optional feature. We
> are more interested in the quality of the architecture, security,
> correctness, testing, and engineering decisions than in the number of
> screens or endpoints delivered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Business Scenario

A company operates multiple organizations using a shared Project & Task
Management platform.

Each organization can have multiple projects and users. Users can
create, assign, update, and monitor tasks.

The platform must support multiple organizations while ensuring that:

> **A user from Organization A must never be able to access or modify
> data belonging to Organization B.**

The platform will eventually support thousands of organizations and
potentially millions of tasks.

The application must therefore be designed with scalability, security,
reliability, and maintainability in mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Required Technology Stack

The following components are mandatory:

### Frontend

Use one modern frontend framework:

-   React
-   Next.js
-   Vue
-   Angular

### Backend

Use one modern backend framework/runtime:

-   Node.js / TypeScript
-   Python
-   Java
-   Go
-   .NET

### Authentication

**Keycloak** is mandatory.

The application must authenticate users using Keycloak/OIDC/OAuth2.

### Database

**PostgreSQL** is mandatory.

### Cache / Supporting Infrastructure

**Redis** is mandatory.

### Containerization

**Docker + Docker Compose** are mandatory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Required Architecture

At minimum, the solution should contain:

``` text
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   Keycloak  │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                           ▼
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│  Frontend   │ ───► │ Backend API │
└─────────────┘      └──────┬──────┘
                            │
                 ┌──────────┴──────────┐
                 ▼                     ▼
          ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
          │ PostgreSQL  │       │    Redis    │
          └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
                                      │
                                      ▼
                               ┌─────────────┐
                               │   Worker    │
                               └─────────────┘
```

You may introduce additional services if justified.

Do not introduce unnecessary microservices simply to make the
architecture look complex.

We are interested in **appropriate architecture**, not maximum
architecture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Core Domain Model

The minimum business hierarchy should be:

``` text
Organization
    │
    ├── Users
    │
    └── Projects
          │
          └── Tasks
```

You may extend the model where useful.

## Organization

Suggested fields:

-   id
-   name
-   status
-   created_at
-   updated_at

## Project

Suggested fields:

-   id
-   organization_id
-   name
-   description
-   status
-   created_at
-   updated_at

## Task

Minimum fields:

-   id
-   organization_id
-   project_id
-   title
-   description
-   status
-   priority
-   owner_id / assignee_id
-   due_date
-   created_at
-   updated_at
-   version

Task status:

``` text
TODO
IN_PROGRESS
DONE
```

Priority:

``` text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

You may add additional fields where justified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Multi-Tenancy

Multi-tenancy is a **mandatory requirement**.

Every organization must operate as an isolated tenant.

The backend must determine the organization/tenant from the
authenticated user's identity and authorization context.

### Important Security Rule

Do **not** trust the frontend to provide a tenant ID as the source of
authorization.

For example, the following request must not allow a user to access
another organization simply by changing the value:

``` http
GET /api/tasks?organization_id=OTHER_ORGANIZATION
```

The server must enforce tenant isolation.

### Expected behavior

If a user belongs to:

``` text
Organization A
```

they must not be able to:

-   Read Organization B tasks
-   Modify Organization B tasks
-   Delete Organization B tasks
-   Read Organization B projects
-   Access Organization B analytics
-   Manipulate Organization B users

Cross-tenant access attempts should return an appropriate authorization
response such as:

``` http
403 Forbidden
```

or

``` http
404 Not Found
```

depending on the API's security design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Role-Based Access Control

RBAC is mandatory.

At minimum implement:

``` text
SUPER_ADMIN
ORG_ADMIN
PROJECT_MANAGER
MEMBER
```

You may refine the permission model.

Example:

| Action                        | SUPER_ADMIN | ORG_ADMIN | PROJECT_MANAGER | MEMBER  |
|-------------------------------|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------------:|:-------:|
| Manage organizations          | ✓           |           |                 |         |
| Manage organization users     | ✓           | ✓         |                 |         |
| Create projects               | ✓           | ✓         | ✓               |         |
| Manage project tasks          | ✓           | ✓         | ✓               |         |
| Create own tasks              | ✓           | ✓         | ✓               | ✓       |
| Update permitted tasks        | ✓           | ✓         | ✓               | ✓       |
| Delete permitted tasks        | ✓           | ✓         | ✓               |         |
| View organization analytics   | ✓           | ✓         | ✓               | Limited |


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Authentication

Keycloak must be used for authentication.

The application must:

-   Authenticate users through Keycloak
-   Validate access tokens on protected API endpoints
-   Identify the authenticated user
-   Enforce authorization based on roles
-   Prevent unauthorized access to API resources
-   Provide logout functionality
-   Provide a user/profile endpoint

Example:

``` http
GET /api/me
```

Expected response should contain information about the authenticated
user and relevant authorization context.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Task Management

Implement secure CRUD functionality.

### Required APIs

``` http
GET    /api/tasks
POST   /api/tasks
GET    /api/tasks/:id
PUT    /api/tasks/:id
DELETE /api/tasks/:id
```

Support useful filtering such as:

``` text
status
priority
assignee
project
due date
search
```

Pagination should be implemented for collection endpoints.

Avoid returning unlimited records.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. Optimistic Concurrency Control

Task updates must support concurrent editing.

Add a version field:

``` text
version
```

Example:

``` text
Task version = 7
```

A client attempts to update version 7.

If another user has already changed the task and the current version is
now 8, the update must fail.

Example:

``` http
409 Conflict
```

The API should communicate that the resource has changed and the client
should reload the latest version.

The implementation may use:

-   Version column
-   Conditional SQL update
-   ETag / If-Match
-   Equivalent concurrency mechanism

Document your approach.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Idempotent Task Creation

Task creation should support idempotency.

Example:

``` http
POST /api/tasks
Idempotency-Key: 4e7c...
```

If the same request is submitted multiple times with the same
idempotency key, the system should not create duplicate tasks.

Document:

-   Where the idempotency key is stored
-   How duplicate requests are detected
-   How long keys are retained
-   What happens if Redis is unavailable
-   How concurrent duplicate requests are handled

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 12. Audit Logging

Important business actions must be auditable.

Create an audit log containing information such as:

-   id
-   organization_id
-   user_id
-   action
-   entity_type
-   entity_id
-   timestamp
-   IP address where appropriate
-   metadata / before-and-after information where appropriate

Examples:

``` text
TASK_CREATED
TASK_UPDATED
TASK_DELETED
PROJECT_CREATED
USER_ROLE_CHANGED
```

Audit logs should be treated as **append-only**.

A normal user must not be able to modify or delete audit records.

Document how audit logging is implemented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 13. Redis Requirements

Redis must be used for at least:

1.  Dashboard/analytics caching
2.  Rate limiting

You may also use Redis for:

-   Session-related data
-   Idempotency keys
-   Background job coordination
-   Temporary locks
-   Profile caching

## Dashboard Cache

For example:

``` text
dashboard:{organization_id}:{user_id}
```

Use a reasonable TTL such as:

``` text
60 seconds
```

The application should invalidate or refresh relevant cache entries when
underlying task data changes.

## Redis Failure

Document what happens if Redis becomes unavailable.

The application should degrade gracefully where practical.

For example:

-   Task CRUD should continue if Redis is only being used for caching
-   Rate limiting behavior should be explicitly defined
-   Idempotency behavior should be safe and documented

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 14. Rate Limiting

Implement API rate limiting.

At minimum protect sensitive endpoints such as:

``` text
POST /api/tasks
PUT /api/tasks/:id
DELETE /api/tasks/:id
```

You may implement rate limiting using:

-   Redis
-   Token bucket
-   Sliding window
-   Fixed window
-   Equivalent approach

Document:

-   Limit
-   Window
-   Key used for rate limiting
-   Behavior when the limit is exceeded

Example:

``` http
429 Too Many Requests
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 15. Background Worker

Implement or demonstrate a background processing mechanism.

Suitable use cases include:

-   Notifications
-   Task reminders
-   Analytics aggregation
-   Audit processing
-   Email simulation
-   Report generation

Example:

``` text
API
 │
 └──► Queue
        │
        ▼
      Worker
        │
        └──► Notification / Processing
```

The worker should demonstrate:

-   Retry handling
-   Failure handling
-   Idempotency
-   Appropriate logging

You may use Redis-backed queues or another appropriate technology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 16. PostgreSQL Requirements

PostgreSQL should be treated as a production database.

Requirements:

-   Database migrations
-   Foreign keys
-   Appropriate constraints
-   Appropriate indexes
-   Transactions where required
-   Avoid N+1 queries
-   Appropriate data types
-   Proper pagination
-   Referential integrity

At minimum, think about indexes for:

``` text
organization_id
project_id
assignee_id
status
due_date
created_at
```

Do not blindly index every column.

Explain important indexing decisions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 17. Database Performance

Provide at least one example of database performance analysis.

For example:

``` sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT ...
```

Demonstrate how you identified and addressed a potentially expensive
query.

Document:

-   Query
-   Initial problem
-   Index or query improvement
-   Result

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 18. Analytics Dashboard

Create a dashboard showing useful project/task information.

At minimum:

### Tasks by Status

``` text
TODO
IN_PROGRESS
DONE
```

### Tasks by Priority

``` text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

### Productivity

Show useful information such as:

-   Total tasks
-   Completed tasks
-   Pending tasks
-   Completion rate
-   Overdue tasks

### Time-Based View

Show task creation/completion trends over time.

The dashboard must respect organization and user authorization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 19. Frontend

The frontend should provide at minimum:

### Authentication

-   Login
-   Logout
-   Current user information

### Organization/Project

-   Project list
-   Project details
-   Appropriate project creation/editing controls

### Tasks

-   Task list
-   Task creation
-   Task details
-   Task editing
-   Task deletion
-   Filtering
-   Pagination
-   Status/priority display

### Dashboard

-   Analytics
-   Charts or useful visualizations
-   Appropriate loading states
-   Error states
-   Empty states

The UI does not need to be visually complex.

Prioritize:

-   Usability
-   Correctness
-   Security
-   Clear information architecture

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 20. API Security

The API must address common security concerns.

At minimum consider:

-   JWT validation
-   Token issuer validation
-   Token audience validation where applicable
-   Role/permission enforcement
-   Tenant isolation
-   Input validation
-   SQL injection protection
-   Secure error responses
-   CORS configuration
-   Rate limiting
-   Authorization on every protected resource
-   Avoiding sensitive information in logs
-   Secure handling of secrets

Never rely solely on frontend authorization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 21. Validation and Error Handling

APIs should return consistent error responses.

Example:

``` json
{
  "error": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Invalid task data",
  "details": {
    "title": "Title is required"
  }
}
```

Handle common conditions such as:

``` text
400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
409 Conflict
422 Unprocessable Entity
429 Too Many Requests
500 Internal Server Error
```

The exact structure is part of your API design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 22. Testing

Automated testing is **mandatory**.

At minimum provide tests for:

### Authentication / Authorization

-   Unauthenticated API request rejected
-   Authenticated user accepted
-   Unauthorized role rejected

### Multi-Tenancy

This is especially important.

Test that:

``` text
User A → Organization A → Task A
```

cannot access:

``` text
User A → Organization B → Task B
```

Test:

-   Read
-   Update
-   Delete

### Task CRUD

Test:

-   Create
-   Read
-   Update
-   Delete
-   Validation

### Concurrency

Test stale task version handling.

### Idempotency

Test duplicate requests with the same idempotency key.

### Redis

Test the relevant cache/rate-limit behavior.

Unit tests alone are not sufficient.

Include integration/API tests for important security boundaries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 23. Health and Readiness

Implement operational endpoints such as:

``` http
GET /health
GET /ready
```

Example distinction:

### `/health`

Indicates whether the process is alive.

### `/ready`

Indicates whether the application is ready to serve requests,
potentially checking dependencies such as:

-   PostgreSQL
-   Redis
-   Required services

Document your design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 24. Observability

Provide reasonable application observability.

At minimum:

-   Structured logs
-   Request ID / correlation ID
-   Useful error logs
-   Authentication/authorization failure logging
-   Worker logs
-   Database error logging
-   Redis error logging

Avoid logging:

-   Passwords
-   Access tokens
-   Client secrets
-   Sensitive personal information unnecessarily

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 25. Docker Requirements

The application must run using Docker Compose.

Example:

``` bash
docker compose up --build
```

Required services should include:

``` text
frontend
backend
postgres
redis
keycloak
```

If a worker is implemented:

``` text
worker
```

should also be included.

Provide:

-   Health checks
-   Persistent PostgreSQL volume
-   Environment-based configuration
-   Docker networks where appropriate
-   Reasonable container configuration
-   No hard-coded production secrets

Where practical, services should run as non-root users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 26. Environment Configuration

Provide:

``` text
.env.example
```

Do not commit real secrets.

Example:

``` env
DATABASE_URL=
REDIS_URL=
KEYCLOAK_URL=
KEYCLOAK_REALM=
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

The exact variables depend on your implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 27. Database Backup and Restore

Provide scripts for PostgreSQL backup and restore.

Example:

``` bash
./scripts/backup.sh
./scripts/restore.sh
```

The backup may use:

``` bash
pg_dump
```

Demonstrate:

1.  Creating a backup
2.  Restoring the database
3.  Verifying restored data

Document:

-   Backup format
-   Backup location
-   Restore procedure
-   What happens if a backup fails
-   Basic RPO/RTO considerations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 28. Disaster Recovery Thinking

You are not required to build a full production disaster recovery
platform.

However, document how you would handle:

### PostgreSQL Failure

-   Database becomes unavailable
-   Data recovery
-   Backup restoration
-   Application behavior

### Redis Failure

-   Cache unavailable
-   Rate limiter unavailable
-   Idempotency storage unavailable

### Worker Failure

-   Jobs pending
-   Failed jobs
-   Retries
-   Duplicate processing

### Application Failure

# 35. Senior-Level Engineering Expectations

We are specifically evaluating the following behaviors.

## Architecture

Can you design a system that remains maintainable as usage grows?

## Security

Do you understand that authentication is not the same as authorization?

Can you enforce tenant isolation on the server?

## Database Engineering

Can you design proper relational models, constraints, indexes, and
transactions?

## Concurrency

Can you identify and handle race conditions?

## Reliability

What happens when Redis, PostgreSQL, a worker, or an external dependency
fails?

GitHub Actions or equivalent pipeline including:

-   Build
-   Test
-   Lint
-   Docker build

### +5 Advanced Worker / Reliability

Production-quality:

-   Queue
-   Retry
-   Dead-letter handling
-   Idempotency
-   Failure recovery

### +3 Advanced Testing

Strong integration/e2e test coverage and meaningful test scenarios.

### +2 OpenAPI / Swagger

Complete API documentation.

### +2 Monitoring

Prometheus/Grafana or equivalent monitoring approach.

### +2 Database Performance

Meaningful query optimization backed by measurement.

### +1 Architecture Diagram

Clear architecture and data-flow diagrams.

# 40. What We Will Look For

A strong senior-level submission will typically demonstrate:

-   Simple but well-thought-out architecture
-   Strong tenant isolation
-   Proper authorization
-   Good PostgreSQL modeling
-   Correct transaction boundaries
-   Thoughtful indexes
-   Correct concurrency handling
-   Safe Redis usage
-   Graceful failure behavior
-   Meaningful automated tests
-   Good Docker practices
-   Clear documentation
-   Good logging and observability
-   Awareness of production trade-offs

A visually impressive application with weak security or poor
architecture will **not** receive a strong score.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 41. Important Evaluation Principle

This assessment is not about completing the largest number of features.

We value:

> **Correctness \> Security \> Architecture \> Reliability \>
> Maintainability \> Feature Count**

If you cannot implement something completely within the timebox,
document:

-   What you implemented
-   What remains
-   How you would complete it
-   Why you prioritized other areas

Clear engineering decisions are part of the assessment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 42. Final Senior Engineering Discussion

After submission, the candidate may be asked to participate in a
**45--60 minute technical discussion**.

Potential discussion topics include:

### Multi-Tenancy

> How would you guarantee that a tenant ID supplied by a malicious
> client cannot bypass authorization?

### Database

> What indexes would you add for a system containing 100 million tasks,
> and why?

### Redis

> What happens if Redis becomes unavailable?

### Concurrency

> Two users edit the same task at exactly the same time. What happens?

### Scaling

> How would you scale the application to 1 million users?

### PostgreSQL Failure

> What happens if PostgreSQL becomes unavailable for 10 minutes?

### Worker

> How do you prevent a notification job from being processed twice?

### Security

> What are the biggest security risks in your implementation?

### AI

> Show us one piece of AI-generated code that you changed or rejected
> and explain why.

### Architecture

> If you had two additional weeks, what would you improve and why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 43. Final Note to Candidate

Build the system as if another engineering team will maintain it after
you leave.

We are not expecting a perfect production system within 2--3 days.

We are looking for evidence that you can:

-   Think beyond CRUD
-   Design secure systems
-   Make sound technical decisions
-   Understand failure modes
-   Write maintainable code
-   Test critical behavior
-   Explain trade-offs
-   Build with production awareness

**Good luck!**
